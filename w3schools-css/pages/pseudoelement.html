            <h1>Image transparency</h1>
            <p> 
                The opacity property is often used together with the :hover 
                selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:
            </p>
            <img class="forest" src="../images/img_forest.jpg" alt="Forest" width="170" height="100">
            <img class="forest" src="../images/img_5terre.jpg" alt="Italy" width="170" height="100">
            <img class="forest" src="../images/img_mountains.jpg" alt="Mountains" width="170" height="100">
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> In IE, a !DOCTYPE must be added for the :hover 
                selector to work on other elements than the a element.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>

                special effect to the first line of a text.

                Second Some more text. And even more, and more, and more,
